Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class (select a group of elements by giving them class attribute)
#id (select individual elements by giving them id attribute, same id can only be used once)
* (sybolizes all elements)
element (idivudual element with no special added attribute)
element, element (two elments, giving them the same properties)
element element (example: h2 p // I want you to select all p elements inside of h2)
element > element (example: h2 > P // I want to select all p that have a direct parent element of h2)
element + element (select any element that is exactly after specified element 
ex. <h2>hi</h2><p>you</p>)
:hover  (changes style on hover ex. p:hover { )
:last-child (select last child of element grouping)
:first-child (select first child of element grouping)
!important (not recommended) ( ex. color: pink !important; ) (superceeds cascading style sheet rule of top to bottom reading)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity (more specific elements will take precident over others)
-Importance (!important tag)
-Source Order (when importing style sheets into css, the order decides which takes preference, the last style that loads in will win out.
