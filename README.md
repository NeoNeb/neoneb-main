Hi there!

Welcome to my Github.

I am currently a self taught developer teaching myself the skills necessary to land my first development job. At this time I spend around 30-40 hrs per week learning. I will be getting a portfolio website up ASAP, so please check back for that.

Clouded Leopard Landing Page --
This started as just a simple landing page but as I have learned more, I have applied new methods to the build. Currently utilizes HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

Gradient Backgrond Generator --

This was an exercise in which I had to use JS DOM manipulation to complete the following tasks:
1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load. 
2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.
3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.

This was a project I buillt to get a better understanding of CSS Grid.

Sticky Note Web App --
This Project was built for further practice with JS DOM manipulation. You can add new sticky notes, edit the text fields within them and double click them to delete them.

Chat Application UI --
This was another project I built to further my understand of CSS Grid.

Todo List --
This was my first exercise in DOM Manipulation. It's not very pretty but I do plan to come back and add style at a later point. The required tasks included:

1. If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done class on and off.
2. Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.
3. BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the 3. delete button next to it (hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)

Satoshi Nakamoto Tribute Page --
This was the first project I ever completed over at freecodecamp.org. It is nothing amazing, but I like to look back on it to see where I came from and where I am now.
